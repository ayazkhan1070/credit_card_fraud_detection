### Key Accomplishments
- **Developed a fraud detection system** using unsupervised learning techniques such as Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF). Performed feature engineering, scaling, and dimensionality reduction (PCA) to identify fraudulent transactions from a dataset of over 280,000 credit card records.
- **Built and deployed** an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to upload transaction data for real-time fraud detection, with anomaly visualizations and classification results.
